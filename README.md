# CS-315-22-Project - RollLang

Drone:  inclination, altitude, temperature, acceleration 

Project 1:

  1. REPORT (pdf):

    Name, ID and section
    
    Name: RollLang

    BNF

    One paragraph explanation for each language construct (i.e. nonterminals) detailing their intended usage and meaning, as well as all of the associated conventions. (Why we have it, how it works, all possible constructions)

    Descriptions of how nontrivial tokens (comments, identifiers, literals, reserved words, etc) are defined in your language. For all of these, explain what your motivations    and constraints were and how they relate to various language criteria such as readability, writability, reliability, etc.

    Evaluate your language in terms of

      Readability

      Writability

      Reliability

  BNF description:

    •	variable identifiers

    •	assignment operator

    •	precedence, associativity of the operators

    •	expressions (arithmetic, relational, boolean, their combination)

    •	loops

    •	conditional statements

    •	statements for input / output

    •	comments

    •	primitive functions for:

      o	reading the inclination of the drone - inclination()

      o	reading the altitude - altitude()

      o	reading the temperature

      o	reading the acceleration

      o	turning on/off video camera

      o	taking pictures with video camera

      o	reading current timestamp from timer
     
      o connecting to the base computer through wi-fi
